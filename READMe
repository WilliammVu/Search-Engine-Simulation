C++ program for a mini search engine

Note: 
- The program was written in MacOS, so the file paths and open function (for opening URL) will be different for other operating systems.

In this simulation of a search engine, the IDE's console input and output will be used. There will be a database class 
and a search result class

The database will consist of 3 parallel txt files:
One holding a list of common search inquiries, one holding a list of website links that correspond to those inquiries,
and one holding the titiles of each of those websites. These are called questions.txt , answers.txt , answer_titles.txt respectively.
These files are parallel to each other. For example, the 36th row of questions.txt would be "Best places to visit in Europe" and 
the 36th row of answers.txt would be a URL corresponding to that inquiry. In the same way would the 36th row of answer_titles.txt be 
"Top Places to Visit in Europe"

The search result class will contain the indexes of the three websites that best match the user's search inquiry. 
With those indexes, you can access the websites' matching search inquiry, URL, and title. 

The algorithm:
user enters a search inquiry or exits program -> 
relevant results are displayed ->
user decides which link to open or exits the selection. They can open as many as they'd like.
user enters a search inquiry or exits program
